# ESP32-WIFI-PROJECT
This project collects data from a sensor and processes it using an RTOS to ensure reliable, real-time task management. The system transmits the measured data to a remote server for monitoring and analysis. Low-power techniques are applied to optimize energy consumption and extend battery life.
